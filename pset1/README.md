CS 61 Problem Set 1
===================

Grading notes (if any)
----------------------
Frequency algorithm used.  This takes top 6 big users of memory.  The
decrementing process creates approximate (possibly inaccurate) percentages.
The heavy hitter code is shared between my code base and my partner's code Serina  
Hu's. I believe that this is allowed under the collaboration policy
(all test code is my own).

Extra credit attempted (if any)
-------------------------------
- frequency heavy hitters (done with Serina Hu)
- sanitizer writeup in SANITIZER.md (split writeup with Serina Hu)
